# Professional JavaScript
In-depth knowledge of JavaScript makes it easier to learn a variety of other frameworks, including React, Angular, and related tools and libraries. This course is designed to help you cover the core JavaScript concepts you need to build modern applications.

You'll start by learning how to represent an HTML document in the Document Object Model (DOM). Next, you'll combine your knowledge of the DOM and Node.js to create a web scraper for practical situations. As you read through further lessons, you'll create a Node.js-based RESTful API using the Express library for Node.js. You'll also understand how modular designs can be used for better reusability and collaboration with multiple developers on a single project. Later chapters will guide you through building unit tests, which ensure that the core functionality of your program is not affected over time. The course will also demonstrate how constructors, async/await, and events can load your applications quickly and efficiently. Finally, you'll gain useful insights into functional programming concepts such as immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

By the end of this course, you'll have the skills you need to tackle any real-world JavaScript development problem using a modern JavaScript approach, both for the client and server sides.

## What you will learn
* Apply the core concepts of functional programming
* Build a Node.js project that uses the Express.js library to host an AP
* Create unit tests for a Node.js project to validate it
* Use the Cheerio library with Node.js to create a basic web scraper
* Develop a React interface to build processing flows
* Use callbacks as a basic way to bring control back

### The examples of this title has been implemented in the Windows/MAC/Linux operating system.
